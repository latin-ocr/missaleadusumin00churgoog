three have no rubrica in the Canon, one is wholly defective in
this part, and two more partially so. Two only have the com-
plete Canon with rubrics. To thaee two lfissals must be added
onc of the manuscript Breviaries in the Library of the York
Minster² which has the Canon with full rubrica. All these
rubrics are given in full, parallel with those of the printed
editione.

It will be found that there was as great variety in Ceremonial
in respect of the Canon of the Mass within the Fae of York, at
various times and before the custom was fixed by the printed

Ι edition, as there is between the three great Uses of Sarum, York,

and Hcreford as drawn out from the printed editions of the ’
Missal by ΜΓ. Maskell in the “Antient Liturgies of the Church
of England”

The Rev. S. Greatheed‚ of South ‚Corringham has very kindly
taken charge of the Plain Chant in this volume. His name will
be a sufficient voucher for the' manner in which this part of the
work has been done.
