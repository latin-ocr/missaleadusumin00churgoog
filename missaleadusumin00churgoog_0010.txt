PREFACE.

Tms Edition of the York Missal has been made from a colla· ι
tion of the manuscript Missals known to exist, and from the

five printed editione.

Ihave to express my sense of the invariable courtesy I
have met with from the owners of these ManuscriptS, who have
most liberally placed them at my disposal for the purposes of
this edition: especially to the Dean and Chapter of York3 the
Rev. John Cott Vicar of Leeds3 the Mastcr and Fellows of
University Collega, foord3 the Master and Fellows of Sidney
Sussex Collega, Cambridge3 the Rector and Officers of the College
of Stonyhurst3 the Curators of the Bodleian3 and Mr. Kerslake,
of Bristol. .

With regard to the collation of these originale, it should
be said, that as a rule, mere verbal variations of rubrica have
not been noted, except in the case of the Canon of the alass,
but any variation of expression which rendered the meaning
at all more clear, or seemed on any other ground worth pre-
serving, has been recorded.

The g1·eatest amount of additional rubric is given in MS. D,
now in the library of Sidney Sussex Collega Cambridge, which
is described below3 the additions and variations supplied by
this Manuscript are of a most interesting character, and *give
very fully the Use in the Cathedral Church at the date when the
hlissal was written.

The variations as to Ceremonial of the Canon of the Mass are
fully given in parallel columns, Ostha seven manuscript Missals,
