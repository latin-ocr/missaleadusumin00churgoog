There can be no doubt that Violette’s is the first edition of the Yorlr
Missal‚ and that, as Mona. Frere'* suggests, judging from the period
during which Violette was engaged in printing, its date is, as nearly as
possible, 1509.

It difi'ers from the later editions only·—

l. Iu omitting the notices as to the different months in the Calendar, ’
which will be found in pp. xlm-xlv.

2. In placing the “Modus finiendi Collectas'' after the first rubric in
the sanctorale, instead of at the close.

3. The “Considerationes circa Missam celebrandam,'' with which the
other Edd. commence, follow the “ Sanctorale.’'

The five editions seem to have been made successively, the one from
the other, and probably only represent a single MS. or, at the outside,
two. The errors of the first edition are, arith the exception of the cor-
rection of a few misprintS, perpetuated throughout; as for instance, in
the omission of a line of the MS. in the first rubrio in “Sabbato Sancto
Paschae,'’ and in putting the Mass for S. Petrocius in April instead of
June. ‚ The editions differ from one another considerably in the length
of the notes in the music.
